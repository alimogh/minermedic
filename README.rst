Starting MinerMedic
-------------------

To run the agent in "headless" mode (i.e. it will run in the background)
execute the "run_headless.sh" script in the root of the directory.

The agent can also be run by simply executing "run.sh", but will not release
control until you press CONTROL-C or kill the process from another window.
